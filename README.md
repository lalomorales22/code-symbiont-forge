# Project Symbiont - AI Co-Pilot Blueprint Dashboard

A comprehensive software blueprint and interactive dashboard for **Project Symbiont**, an AI co-pilot designed for software development and accelerated learning through Human-AI Symbiosis.

## üß¨ What is Project Symbiont?

Project Symbiont represents the future of human-AI collaboration in software development. Rather than being a mere tool, it acts as a true **co-evolutionary partner** that learns with you, adapts to your coding style, and grows alongside your skills.

### Core Philosophy
- **Human-AI Symbiosis**: You and the AI form a "Centaur Team"
- **Co-Evolution**: Both human and AI learn and adapt together
- **Augment, Don't Replace**: AI handles routine work while humans focus on insights and decisions
- **Personalized Learning**: Explanations and code generation tailored to your specific project and skill level

## üöÄ Live Demo

This dashboard showcases the complete Project Symbiont blueprint:

- **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual representation of the full-stack system
- **Symbiotic Workflow**: Interactive demonstration of the human-AI collaboration cycle
- **CLI Interface Demo**: Live examples of the command-line tools in action
- **Technology Stack**: Detailed breakdown of all technologies and their roles
- **Ethical Guidelines**: Privacy and augmentation principles

## üèó Project Symbiont Architecture

### Frontend Layer
- **CLI Interface** (Node.js): Primary developer interaction
- **Web Dashboard** (React): Visualization and management

### Backend Layer
- **API Server** (Express.js): Request orchestration
- **AI Core Service** (Python/FastAPI): LLM orchestration and personalization

### Data Layer
- **MySQL Database**: User profiles, project context, interaction logs
- **Vector Embeddings**: Code similarity and context matching
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment

## üéØ Core Symbiont Commands (Planned)

```bash
# Initialize symbiotic partnership
symbiont init

# Generate code matching your style
symbiont do "create a UserCard component with avatar and status"

# Learn concepts through your codebase
symbiont learn "explain React hooks in my useAuth hook"

# Intelligent debugging with context
symbiont debug "Cannot find module error"

# Provide feedback for AI improvement
symbiont correct

# Auto-generate documentation
symbiont doc

# Suggest code improvements
symbiont refactor UserCard.tsx
```

## üß† The Symbiotic Learning Loop

1. **Human Action**: Developer codes, runs commands, asks questions
2. **AI Analysis**: AI analyzes context, learns patterns, adapts model
3. **Symbiotic Output**: AI provides personalized, contextual assistance
4. **Human Evolution**: Developer learns faster, focuses on strategy

## üîí Privacy & Ethics

- **Privacy by Design**: On-device computation prioritized
- **Transparent AI**: Every suggestion includes reasoning
- **User Control**: All AI actions require explicit confirmation
- **Skill Building**: Prevents dependency, promotes understanding
- **Data Ownership**: Full export/delete capabilities for user data

## üöß Development Status

This dashboard represents the **blueprint phase** of Project Symbiont. The actual CLI tool and AI services are planned for future development phases.

### Current Phase: Blueprint & Visualization ‚úÖ
- Interactive dashboard showcasing the complete vision
- Architecture diagrams and workflow demonstrations
- Technology stack planning and integration roadmap

### Next Phases: Implementation üîÑ
- CLI tool development (Node.js)
- AI Core Service (Python/FastAPI)
- Database schema implementation
- LLM integration and personalization engine

## üí° Technology Choices

This dashboard is built with:
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** for consistent, accessible components
- **Lucide React** for beautiful icons
- **Recharts** for data visualization (future use)
